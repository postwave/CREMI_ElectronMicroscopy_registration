volumes --> images(and annotated  images?)
annotations --> discrete values(maybe class_id)

* I think I'll only need to handle /volumes/raw --> original images

* Use $(python -m torch.utils.bottleneck simple_autoencoder.py) to profile the code

Using half precision + ADAM, one could set eps=1e-4, since default eps for ADAM is 1e-8, too small for half.
Add conv and deconv calculator in helper.py

(UNSOLVED)*** How is conv2d+upsample vs. conv2dTranspose? ***

debug the network: dimensions, dtypes.

networking is working.

If Forward/Backward pass size is too huge, check shape of the tensors to see if you set the conv layer wrong.

autoencoder working.
autoencoder's output start to make sense
